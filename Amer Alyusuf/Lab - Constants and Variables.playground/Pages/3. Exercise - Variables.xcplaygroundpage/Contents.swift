//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
var schooling = 1
schooling += 1
print(schooling)

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
// Yes, it compiles
// Becuase a variable is mutable, a constant is not.
print("Because a variable declared with the word 'var' is mutable. A constant declared with the word 'let' is not.")
