 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling :Int = 40
print ("The number years of school compleated is : \(schooling)")

/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling = 45
print ("The number years of school compleated is : \(schooling)")

/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print ("Yes the code is compiled , because in the variables we can update the value and change it at any time , but the constant value is not allowed !")
