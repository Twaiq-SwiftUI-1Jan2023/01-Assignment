/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

var userName = "Abdullah"
print("user can change their name so it decleared as a variable")
var userAge = 34
print("user can change their age so it decleared as a variable")
var dailySteps = 2000
print("steps change as long as the user walking so it decleared as a variable")
let goalSteps = 10000
print("goal every day is 1000 so it decleared as a constant")
var heartRate = 80
print("heart rate usually between 60 rpm to 100rpm so it decleared as a variable")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
