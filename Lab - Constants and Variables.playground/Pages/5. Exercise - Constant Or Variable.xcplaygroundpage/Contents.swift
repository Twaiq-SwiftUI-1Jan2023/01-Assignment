/*:
 ## Exercise - Constant or Variable?
 
 Imagine you're creating a simple photo sharing app. You want to keep track of the following metrics for each post:
- Number of likes: the number of likes that a photo has received
- Number of comments: the number of comments other users have left on the photo
- Year created: The year the post was created
- Month created: The month the post was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
- Day created: The day of the month the post was created
 
 For each of the metrics above, declare either a constant or a variable and assign it a value corresponding to a hypothetical post. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.

var NumberOflikes :Int = 2000
var NumberOfcomment :String = "200K"
let day:Int = 02
let month : Int = 09
let year : Int = 2010


print ("posted at \(day) / \(month) / \(year)" )
print ("Likes \(NumberOflikes)   Comment \(NumberOfcomment)")
