/*:
## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.
 */
var FirstDecimal=2
var secondDecimal=7

//:  Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var TrueOrFalse :Bool
var FirstDecima :Int
 
print("not equle")

//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
print("binary operator == can not be applied to operands of type int and bool")

//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var num=2
var FirstDecima1 :Int=9
print(num)
var num1=FirstDecima1
print(num1)
